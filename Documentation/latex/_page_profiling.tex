\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item \mbox{\hyperlink{_page_profiling_empty_scene}{Profiling Empty Scene}}
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Android
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item CPU\+: ≈20\%
\item GPU\+: 9\%
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item Web\+GL
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item CPU\+: ≈30\%
\item GPU\+: 22\% ~\newline

\end{DoxyItemize}
\item In an empty scene, Web\+GL uses about 10\% more GPU \& CPU than Android.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item \mbox{\hyperlink{_page_profiling_fill_rate}{Profiling Fill Rate}}
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Android\+: Filling the view resulted in a 25\% increase in GPU usage (from 9\% up to 35\%); no increase in CPU usage (≈20\%).
\item Web\+GL\+: Filling the view resulted in a 40\% increase in GPU usage (from 22\% up to 60\%); no increase in CPU usage (≈40\%).
\item General
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item GPU usage seems to drop linearly as the fill decreases.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item \mbox{\hyperlink{_page_profiling_m_s_a_a}{Profiling MSAA}}
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Android\+: MSAA had a minor effect with x2 resulted in about 2\% increase (from 20\% up to 22\%); MSAA x4 resulted in about 4\% increase (from 20\% up to 24\%). Increasing MSAA seemed to have a minor effect on CPU usage (from 20\% to 25\%).
\item Web\+GL\+: MSAA had a major effect with x2 resulted in about 30\% increase (from 60\% to 75\%); MSAA x4 resulted in about 60\% increase (from 60\% to 95\%). Increasing MSAA seemed to have no effect on CPU usage.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item \mbox{\hyperlink{_page_profiling_terrain}{Profiling Terrain}}
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item General
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item The Tiny Terrain test demonstrates the terrain has minimal effect on GPU or CPU when it does not take up much of the screen.
\item Since the Tiny Terrain test had minimal effect, an increase in load is due to shader complexity.
\item The terrain took 50\% more GPU than the simple quad.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item Android
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item The terrain took 50\% more GPU than the simple quad.
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Half fill\+: from 20\% to 33\%
\item Full fill\+: from 35\% to 50\%
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item The CPU load did not change relative to the Empty Scene, regardless of how much of the terrain was displayed. ~\newline

\end{DoxyItemize}
\item Web\+GL
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item The terrain took 50\% more GPU than the simple quad.
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Half fill\+: from 40\% to 60\%
\item Full fill\+: from 60\% to 90\%
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item The CPU load did not change relative to how much of the terrain was displayed, but did generally increase the CPU load 25\% (from 40\% to 50\%) ~\newline
